<p>The purpose of this web-site is to use Javascript to view TEI documents in interesting ways.
For technical information, you can consult the source code, which is located at
<a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/rgrempel/tei_visualization">
http://github.com/rgrempel/tei_visualization
</a>.</p>

<p>To get started here, use the "Documents" menu to either open a TEI document that is already
here, or upload a new one of your own. Once the document is open, you can use the other menus
to explore it in various ways. Most menus open a "window" of one kind or another ... you can 
use the buttons on the window header to move the windows into the left side, right side, or
into a tab below.</p>

<p>The "panels" menu will show a list of windows you have currently open, and you can use
it to switch among them.</p>

<p>Note that this site <b>only works with Firefox</b> at the moment. The code is heavily dependent on
client-side XSLT, and is using XSLT features that only Firefox is supporting.</p>
