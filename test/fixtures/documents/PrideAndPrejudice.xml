                <p>In a few days <name type="person" key="bingley">Mr. Bingley</name> returned <name type="person" key="mr_bennet">Mr. Bennet's</name>
                    visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young
                    ladies, <seg ana="#beauty">of whose beauty he had heard much</seg>; but he saw only <rs type="person" key="mr_bennet">the

                    a blue coat, and rode a black horse.</p>

                <p>An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had <name type="person" key="mrs_bennet">Mrs. Bennet</name>
                    planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. <name type="person"
                        key="mr_bingley">Mr. Bingley</name> was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the
                    honour of their invitation, etc. <name type="person" key="mrs_bennet">Mrs. Bennet</name> was quite disconcerted. She could not
                    imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in <name type="place" key="hertfordshire"
                    >Hertfordshire</name>; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at
                        <name type="place" key="netherfield">Netherfield</name> as he ought to be. <name type="person" key="lady_lucas">Lady
                    Lucas</name> quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to <name type="place" key="london">London</name>
                    only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that <name type="person" key="mr_bingley">Mr. Bingley</name>
                    was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were
                    comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve <rs type="name" key="mr_bingley">he</rs> brought only six
                    with him from <name type="place" key="london">London</name>--his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the
                    assembly room it consisted of only five altogether--<name type="person" key="mr_bingely">Mr. Bingley</name>, his two sisters, the
                    husband of the eldest, and another young man.</p>

                <p><name type="person" key="mr_bingley">Mr. Bingley</name> was <seg ana="#beauty">good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant
                        countenance</seg>, and <seg ana="#temperment">easy, unaffected manners</seg>. His sisters were fine women, <seg ana="#beauty"
                        >with an air of decided fashion</seg>. His brother-in-law, <name type="person" key="mr_hurst">Mr. Hurst</name>, merely <seg
                        ana="#beauty">looked the gentleman</seg>; but his friend <name type="person" key="mr_darcy">Mr. Darcy</name> soon drew the
                    attention of the room by his <seg ana="#beauty">fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien</seg> and the report which was in
                    general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his <seg ana="#wealth">having ten thousand a year</seg>. The
                    gentlemen pronounced him to be a <seg ana="#beauty">fine figure of a man</seg>, the ladies declared he was <seg ana="#beauty">much
                        handsomer than <name type="person" key="mr_bingley">Mr. Bingley</name></seg>, and he was looked at with great admiration for
                    about half the evening, till <seg ana="#temperment">his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was
                        discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased</seg>; and not all his <seg ana="#wealth">large
                        estate in <name type="place" key="derbyshire">Derbyshire</name></seg> could then save him from having a <seg ana="#beauty"
                        >most forbidding, disagreeable countenance</seg>, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.</p>

                <p><name type="person" key="mr_bingley">Mr. Bingley</name> had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he
                    was lively and unreserved, <seg ana="#dancing">danced every dance</seg>, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of
                    giving one himself at <name type="place" key="netherfield">Netherfield</name>. Such <seg ana="#temperment">amiable qualities</seg>
                    must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! <name type="person" key="mr_darcy">Mr. Darcy</name>
                    <seg ana="#dancing">danced only once</seg> with <name type="person" key="mrs_hurst">Mrs. Hurst</name> and once with <name
                        type="person" key="miss_bingley">Miss Bingley</name>, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the
                    evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided. He was the <seg
                        ana="#temperment">proudest, most disagreeable man in the world</seg>, and everybody hoped that he would never come there
                    again. Amongst the most violent against him was <name type="person" key="mrs_bennet">Mrs. Bennet</name>, whose dislike of his
                    general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.</p>

                <p><name type="person" key="elizabeth_bennet">Elizabeth Bennet</name> had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to <seg ana="#dancing"
                        >sit down for two dances</seg>; and during part of that time, <name type="person" key="mr_darcy">Mr. Darcy</name> had been

                    never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good
                    spirits to <name type="place" key="longbourn">Longbourn</name>, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal
                    inhabitants. They found <name type="person" key="mr_bennet">Mr. Bennet</name> still up. With a book he was regardless of time; and
                    on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the events of an evening which had raised such splendid
                    expectations. <rs type="person" key="mr_bennet">He</rs> had rather hoped that <rs type="person" key="mrs_bennet">his wife's</rs>
                    views on <rs type="person" key="mr_bingley">the stranger</rs> would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different
                    story to hear.</p>

                <p><said who="mrs_bennet">"Oh! my dear <name type="person" key="mr_bennet">Mr. Bennet</name>,"</said> as she entered the room, <said
                        who="mrs_bennet">"we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. <name type="person"
                            key="jane">Jane</name> was <seg ana="#beauty">so admired</seg>, nothing could be like it. Everybody said <seg

                        asked a second time. First of all, he asked <name type="person" key="miss_lucas">Miss Lucas</name>. I was so vexed to see him
                            <seg ana="#dancing">stand up with her</seg>! But, however, he did not <seg ana="#beauty">admire</seg> her at all; indeed,
                        nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with <name type="person" key="jane">Jane</name> as she was going down the
                        dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then the two third he <seg

                            again, and the two sixth with <name type="person" key="lizzy">Lizzy</name>, and the <emph>Boulanger</emph>--</seg>"</said></p>

                <p><said who="mr_bennet">"If he had had any compassion for <emph>me</emph>,"</said> cried her husband impatiently, <said
                        who="mr_bennet">"he <seg ana="#dancing">would not have danced half so much</seg>! For God's sake, say no more of his partners. O that he had sprained
                        his ankle in the first place!"</said></p>

                <p><said who="mrs_bingley">Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with <rs type="person" key="mr_bingley">him</rs>. He is so <seg

                    saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon <name type="person" key="mrs_hurst">Mrs. Hurst's</name> gown--"</said></p>

                <p>Here she was interrupted again. <name type="person" key="mr_bennet">Mr. Bennet</name> protested against any <seg

                <head>Chapter 4</head>

                <p> When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of <name type="person" key="mr_bingley">Mr.
                        Bingley</name> before, expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him.</p>

                <p>"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much
                    ease, with such perfect good breeding!"</p>

                <p>"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby
                    complete."</p>

                <p>"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such a compliment."</p>

                <p>"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take <emph>you</emph> by surprise, and
                        <emph>me</emph> never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five
                    times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I
                    give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person."</p>

                <p>"Dear Lizzy!"</p>

                <p>"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good
                    and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life."</p>

                <p>"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what I think."</p>

                <p>"I know you do; and it is <emph>that</emph> which makes the wonder. With <emph>your</emph> good sense, to be so honestly blind to
                    the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it everywhere. But to be candid
                    without ostentation or design--to take the good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the
                    bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters, too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his."</p>

                <p>"Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother,
                    and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her."</p>

                <p>Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general;
                    and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by any
                    attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good
                    humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited. They
                    were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds,
                    were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect
                    entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a
                    circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.</p>


                <p><name type="person" key="mr_bingley">Mr. Bingley</name> inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his
                    father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. <name type="person" key="mr_bingley">Mr. Bingley</name>
                    intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a
                    manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his
                    days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.</p>

                <p>His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was
                    by no means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less
                    disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. <name type="person" key="mr_bingley">Mr. Bingley</name> had not been
                    of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it
                    for half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and
                    took it immediately.</p>

                <p>Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy
                    by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and
                    though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of
                    his judgement the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was
                    clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that
                    respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving
                    offense.</p>

                <p>The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant
                    people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no
                    stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.
                    Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
                    felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she
                    smiled too much.</p>

                <p><name type="person" key="mrs_hurst">Mrs. Hurst</name> and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her,
                    and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they would not object to know more of.<name type="person" key="miss_bennet"
                        >Miss Bennet</name> was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think
                    of her as he chose.</p>
